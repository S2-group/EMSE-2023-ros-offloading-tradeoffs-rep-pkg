# Empirical Evaluation of Computation Offloading Strategies in Robotic Systems

This repository contains raw data outputs and complete data analysis of the results obtained in the empirical experiments conducted with the purpose of evaluation 
of computation offloading strategies in ROS-based systems. The experiments are conducted as a part of a Computer Science MSc thesis at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

The repository consists of three major parts:
- **figures**: bar chart figures in *pdf* format created as outputs of data analysis. All figures in this direcotory are imported in the thesis paper, where they are 
thoroughly explained;
- **raw data**: raw outputs of the experiments in *csv* format. The entire content of this direcotory is the direct output of the experiment conducted via the Robot Runner 
experiment orchestration tool;
- **statistical_tests**: R project containing the source code of R markdown notebooks in *Rmd* format, along with the HTML visualisation of the notebooks in 
*nb.html* format. Notebooks document the complete data analysis process and the R code used for statistical analysis. The analysis is conducted with R version 4.1.1 on 
Ubuntu 18.04.5.

## Repository structure

Each of the three main direcotories (mentioned above) is organised in the following subdirectories:
